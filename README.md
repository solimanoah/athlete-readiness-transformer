## How to Run

The complete training and evaluation process is implemented in the Colab notebook: [athlete_readiness_project.ipynb](./notebooks/athlete_readiness_project.ipynb)

To reproduce results:
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**
2. Download the five data files (`readiness_timeseries.csv`, `schema.json`, `normalization_stats.json`, `simulation_config.json`, `splits_loao.json`) from the repository.
3. Upload them to your Google Drive using a similar directory structure used in the notebook (e.g., `/MyDrive/athlete_readiness_project/data/raw/`).
4. Update any Drive paths in the first few code cells if your setup differs.
5. Run all cells sequentially to train and evaluate the model.
