# Example Data Generation

Included in the example-data/ folder are data files I used to complete this project.

[splits_loao.json](./splits_loao.json) holds the train/val/test splits for each fold.

[normalization_stats.json](./normalization_stats.json) holds the statistics (mean and sd) used to normalize features for every athlete.

[simulation_config.json](./simulation_config.json) holds the coefficients, noise levels, and random seeds used to reproduce the synthetic dataset.

[schema.json](./schema.json) describes column names, data types, units, and feature/label definitions.
